# Platformer
Cameron LaFerney and Nathan Roberts join forces to create an awesome platformer game.

1. URL: https://github.com/Gilighost/Platformer.git
2. Brief summary of what the program does:
  Become a record at a thriving discotheque, and boogie to some neat jams.
3. Bugs: Sometimes can jump off of wall, camera cannot follow player below goal Y-position 
4. Cameron: Enemy classes, Explosion class, Backgrounds, audio, level text files, Keyboard input, splashscreen, win screen
5. Nathan: LevelReader class, Camera class, Component class, Block class, Goal class, level data handling
6. Both: Player class, images, Game1
7. The percentage of work performed by each teammate: Cameron - 50, Nathan - 50

8. Note:  As evidenced by this project's commit log, Nathan's contributions are more or less evenly spread out, 
while the majority of Cameron's contributions occur in the final days before the extended due date.  This was 
due to a miscommunication between both contributors.
